Module 7: Platform as a Service and Microsoft Azure Stack

Lab: Configuring Platform as a Service in Azure Stack
-----------------------------------------------------

Scenario

The SQL and MySQL Resource Providers have been installed in the Azure Stack
environment but have not been configured with hosting servers. Additionally,
Plans and Offers have not been configured for either SQL or MySQL databases. You
need to ensure that tenants can provision databases in Azure Stack by
configuring the hosting servers that will be used to host these databases. You
must also ensure that resources for both SQL and MySQL are not overprovisioned
by configuring Quotas. You must test that databases can be provisioned
successfully using the Azure Stack Portal. One of Contoso’s customers has a
company intranet that they want to host in Azure Stack. You must configure App
Service in Azure Stack to facilitate this.

Objectives

After completing this lab, you will be able to:

-   Add hosting servers to the SQL and MySQL resource providers.

-   Configure a Plan and Offer for the SQL and MySQL resource providers.

-   Provision a SQL and MySQL databases using the Azure Stack Portal.

-   Provision websites using App Service.

Lab Setup

Estimated Time: 75 minutes

**Host Computer MAS-HOST01**

**User Name:** AzureStack\\AzureStackAdminX

### Exercise 1: Adding hosting servers

Scenario

Before tenants can provision databases in Azure Stack the SQL and MySQL resource
providers must be connected to a hosting server. This is the actual SQL instance
that will be used to host provisioned databases in Azure Stack. You must add a
hosting server to both the SQL and MySQL resource providers.

The main tasks for this exercise are as follows:

1. Add a hosting server to the SQL resource provider

2. Add a hosting server to the MySQL resource provider

### Exercise 2: Configuring a Plan and Offer

Scenario

In order to offer SQL database services to tenants, you must create a Plan and
an Offer for them. This will allow you to limit the amount of database resources
used by tenants by using Quotas. After configuring the Plan and Offer, tenants
can subscribe to the Offer and begin to provision their own databases.

Module 3: Deploying Microsoft Azure Stack

Lab: Confirming prerequisites and installing Microsoft Azure Stack

### Exercise 1: Confirming the Prerequisites

####   Task 1: Confirm the CPU meets the requirements

1.  On **MAS-HOST01**, click **Start**, then right-click **Windows PowerShell
    a**nd then More, then click **Run as administrator**.

2.  In the **User Account Control** dialog, click **Yes**

3.  In the **Administrator: Windows PowerShell** Console enter the following
    PowerShell command and press Enter:

Get-CimInstance -ClassName Win32_Processor -Property Name,
SecondLevelAddressTranslationExtensions, VirtualizationFirmwareEnabled,
VMMonitorModeExtensions \|

Format-List Name, SecondLevelAddressTranslationExtensions,
VirtualizationFirmwareEnabled, VMMonitorModeExtensions

1.  In the information that is returned, review the following:

-   SecondLevelAddressTranslationExtensions

-   VirtualizationFirmwareEnabled

-   VMMonitorModeExtensions

1.  Enter the following PowerShell command and press Enter:

(Get-CimInstance -ClassName Win32_Processor).Count

1.  Ensure the number returned is **2** or higher.

2.  Enter the following PowerShell command and press Enter:

Get-CimInstance -ClassName Win32_Processor -Property Name, SocketDesignation,
NumberOfCores, NumberOfEnabledCore, NumberOfLogicalProcessors \| Format-List
Name, SocketDesignation, NumberOfCores, NumberOfEnabledCore,
NumberOfLogicalProcessors

1.  Ensure the **NumberOfCores** for each CPU returned is **6** or higher.

2.  Leave the **Administrator: Windows PowerShel**l Console open.

####   Task 2: Confirm the number of drives

1.  In the **Administrator: Windows PowerShell** Console on **MAS-HOST01** enter
    the following **PowerShell** command and press Enter:

\$DiskIndexes = Get-CimInstance -ClassName Win32_DiskPartition \| Where-Object
-FilterScript {\$_.BootPartition -eq \$true} \| Select-Object -ExpandProperty
DiskIndex

1.  This will obtain the Disk Index of the disk partitions that are part of the
    boot process, whether they be VHDX file or physical disk.

2.  Enter the following **PowerShell** command to see the Disk Indexes and press
    enter:

\$DiskIndexes

1.  Enter the following PowerShell command and press Enter:

Get-PhysicalDisk \| Where-Object -FilterScript {\$DiskIndexes -notcontains
\$*.DeviceID} \| Format-Table FriendlyName, OperationalStatus, HealthStatus,
\@{Name="Size";Expression={(\$*.Size / 1GB).ToString() + " GB"}}

1.  This shows the disks that are not part of the operating system boot process.
    You should have at least 4 disks listed.

####   Task 3: Confirm the quantity of memory

1.  In the **Administrator: Windows PowerShell** Console on MAS-HOST01 enter the
    following **PowerShell** command and press Enter:

\$Memory = (Get-Ciminstance Win32_OperatingSystem \| Select-Object
-ExpandProperty MaxProcessMemorySize) /1GB

1.  Enter the following **PowerShell** command to see the amount of memory
    installed and press enter:

\$Memory

1.  To round the number, enter the following **PowerShell** command and press
    enter:

2.  This will display the amount of memory in GB.

3.  Close the **Administrator: Windows PowerShell** window.

**Results**: After this exercise, you should have confirmed the hardware on
which the Azure Stack Development Kit is to be deployed meets the prerequisites.

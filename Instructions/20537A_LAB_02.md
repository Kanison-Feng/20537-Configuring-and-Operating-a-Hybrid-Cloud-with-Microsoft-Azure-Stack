### Exercise 1: Reviewing the Azure Stack Infrastructure Components

Scenario

The Azure Stack infrastructure is comprised of a number of virtual machines.
Most of the administrative tools for the infrastructure components have been
installed on the Hyper-V host computers. You must use these tools to confirm the
availability of each Azure Stack component.

The main tasks for this exercise are as follows:

1. Azure Stack Active Directory

2. Azure Stack Storage Spaces

3. Azure Stack Network Controller

4. Azure Stack Software Load Balancer

####   Task 1: Azure Stack Active Directory

To perform this task, use the computer and tool information in the following
table.

| Location                 | Value                                    |
|--------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Computer                 | **MAS-HOST01**                           |
| Tool                     | **Active Directory Users and Computers** |
| Location                 | **Start\\Administrative Tools**          |
| Organizational Unit (OU) | **Users**                                |

1.  In **Active Directory Users and Computers** review the Azure Stack objects
    in the following OUs:

-   Users

-   Managed Service Accounts

-   Service Principals.

-   Computers

-   Domain Controllers

####   Task 2: Azure Stack Storage Spaces

To perform this task, use the computer and tool information in the following
table.

| Location | Value                  |
|----------|------------------------|
| Computer | **MAS-HOST01**         |
| Tool     | **Windows PowerShell** |
| Location | **Start**              |

1.  Run the following Windows PowerShell command by pressing Enter after each
    one and review the information returned:

Get-Cluster \| Format-List \*

Get-ClusterStorageSpacesDirect \| Format-List \*

Get-PhysicalDisk

####   Task 3: Azure Stack Network Controller

>   **Note:** In this task, you connect to an Azure Stack infrastructure virtual
>   machine using Hyper-V Manager. In the case where multiple users are
>   accessing the same Azure Stack host, only 1 connection is available. In this
>   scenario, the instructor will perform this task and students should review
>   the instructors screen instead of performing the task themselves.

To perform this task, use the computer and tool information in the following
table.

| Location        | Value                            |
|-----------------|----------------------------------|
| Computer        | **MAS-HOST01**                   |
| Tool            | **Hyper-V Manager**              |
| Location        | **Windows Administrative Tools** |
| Virtual Machine | **AzS-NC01**                     |

1.  In **Hyper-V Manager**, connect to the **AzS-NC01** VM.

2.  Sign in using **Pa55w.rd** as the password.

3.  Start a **Windows PowerShell** command prompt by typing **Start
    PowerShell**.

4.  In the **Windows PowerShell** window, type **Get-NetworkController**, and
    review the information returned.

5.  Close **PowerShell** and then sign out of **AzS-NC01**.

####   Task 4: Azure Stack Software Load Balancer

To perform this task, use the computer and tool information in the following
table.

| Location     | Value                                                                         |
|--------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Computer     | **MAS-HOST01**                                                                |
| Tool         | **Azure Stack Portal**                                                        |
| View         | [More](file:///\\CONTOSO-DC1\Media\System%20Center%202012%20SP1) **Services** |
| Text to type | **balancer**                                                                  |

1.  Open Internet Explorer and browse to
    **https://adminportal.local.azurestack.external**

2.  Sign into **Azure Stack** with the following credentials:

-   Username: **AzureStack\\AzureStackAdminX**

-   Password: **Pa55w.rd**

1.  From the **More Services** section search **balancers**

2.  Review the information provided for the **FrontEndServersLoadBalancer**

3.  Review the information provided for the **ManagementServersLoadBalancer**

4.  Close the **Azure Stack Portal.**

**Results**: After this exercise, you should have used the administrative tools
on the Hyper-V host to confirm availability of the Azure Stack infrastructure
components.

**Question:** You need to provide access for a support engineer to access the
Azure Stack infrastructure resources. What are two methods you can adopt to
facilitate this?

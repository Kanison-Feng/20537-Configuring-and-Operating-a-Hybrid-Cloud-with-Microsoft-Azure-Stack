### Exercise 1: Reviewing the Azure Stack Infrastructure Components

Scenario

The Azure Stack infrastructure is comprised of a number of virtual
machines. Most of the administrative tools for the infrastructure
components have been installed on the Hyper-V host computers. You must
use these tools to confirm the availability of each Azure Stack
component.

The main tasks for this exercise are as follows:

1\. Azure Stack Active Directory

2\. Azure Stack Storage Spaces

3\. Azure Stack Network Controller

4\. Azure Stack Software Load Balancer

####   Task 1: Azure Stack Active Directory {#task-1-azure-stack-active-directory .ProcedureHeading}

To perform this task, use the computer and tool information in the
following table.

  Location                   Value
  -------------------------- ------------------------------------------
  Computer                   **MAS-HOST01**
  Tool                       **Active Directory Users and Computers**
  Location                   **Start\\Administrative Tools**
  Organizational Unit (OU)   **Users**

1.  In **Active Directory Users and Computers** review the Azure Stack
    objects in the following OUs:

-   Users

-   Managed Service Accounts

-   Service Principals.

-   Computers

-   Domain Controllers

####   Task 2: Azure Stack Storage Spaces {#task-2-azure-stack-storage-spaces .ProcedureHeading}

To perform this task, use the computer and tool information in the
following table.

  Location   Value
  ---------- ------------------------
  Computer   **MAS-HOST01**
  Tool       **Windows PowerShell**
  Location   **Start**

1.  Run the following Windows PowerShell command by pressing Enter after
    each one and review the information returned:

Get-Cluster | Format-List \*

Get-ClusterStorageSpacesDirect | Format-List \*

Get-PhysicalDisk

####   Task 3: Azure Stack Network Controller {#task-3-azure-stack-network-controller .ProcedureHeading}

> ![](media/image1.png){width="0.19in" height="0.19in"} **Note:** In
> this task, you connect to an Azure Stack infrastructure virtual
> machine using Hyper-V Manager. In the case where multiple users are
> accessing the same Azure Stack host, only 1 connection is available.
> In this scenario, the instructor will perform this task and students
> should review the instructors screen instead of performing the task
> themselves.

To perform this task, use the computer and tool information in the
following table.

  Location          Value
  ----------------- ----------------------------------
  Computer          **MAS-HOST01**
  Tool              **Hyper-V Manager**
  Location          **Windows Administrative Tools**
  Virtual Machine   **AzS-NC01**

1.  In **Hyper-V Manager**, connect to the **AzS-NC01** VM.

Sign in using **Pa55w.rd** as the password.

1.  Start a **Windows PowerShell** command prompt by typing **Start
    PowerShell**.

2.  In the **Windows** **PowerShell** window, type
    **Get-NetworkController**, and review the information returned.

3.  Close **PowerShell** and then sign out of **AzS-NC01**.

####   Task 4: Azure Stack Software Load Balancer {#task-4-azure-stack-software-load-balancer .ProcedureHeading}

To perform this task, use the computer and tool information in the
following table.

  Location       Value
  -------------- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Computer       **MAS-HOST01**
  Tool           **Azure Stack Portal**
  View           **[More](file:///\\CONTOSO-DC1\Media\System%20Center%202012%20SP1) Services**
  Text to type   **balancer**

1.  Open Internet Explorer and browse to
    **https://adminportal.local.azurestack.external**

2.  Sign into **Azure Stack** with the following credentials:

-   Username: **AzureStack\\AzureStackAdminX**

-   Password: **Pa55w.rd**

1.  From the **More Services** section search **balancers**

2.  Review the information provided for the
    **FrontEndServersLoadBalancer**

3.  Review the information provided for the
    **ManagementServersLoadBalancer**

4.  Close the **Azure Stack Portal.**

**Results**: After this exercise, you should have used the
administrative tools on the Hyper-V host to confirm availability of the
Azure Stack infrastructure components.

> **Question:** You need to provide access for a support engineer to
> access the Azure Stack infrastructure resources. What are two methods
> you can adopt to facilitate this?
